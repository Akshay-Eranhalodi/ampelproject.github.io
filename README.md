## AMPEL in a nutshell

AMPEL is a _modular_ and _scalable_ platform with explicit _provenance_ tracking, suited for systematically processing large&mdash;possibly complex and heterogeneous&mdash;datasets either in real time or offline. This includes selecting, analyzing, updating, combining, enriching and reacting to data.

The framework requires analysis and reaction logic to be broken down in adequate independent units.
AMPEL was originaly developed to solve challenges in the context of experimental astrophysics, but is general enough to be applicable in various fields.
